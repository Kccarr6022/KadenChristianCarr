    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Junior at Florida Gulf Coast University. I began studying here
      after receiving my Associates of Arts degree alongside my High School
      diploma in 2020 at the State College of Florida (taking advantage of a
      rigorous dual enrollment program). I plan to graduate with a Bachelor of
      Science in Software Engineering in the Spring of 2023. I have prior
      experience in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Visual Basic, Java,
      Python, and C++. I have plenty of leadership experience, including
      Treasurer of the FGCU running club, lead sales associate at Leslie's
      Bradenton, and lead software developer for a local start-up.
