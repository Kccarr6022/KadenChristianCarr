          I am a Junior at Florida Gulf Coast University. I began studying here
          after receiving my Associates of Arts degree alongside my High School
          diploma in 2020 at the State College of Florida (taking advantage of a
          rigorous dual enrollment program). I plan to graduate with a Bachelor
          of Science in Software Engineering in the Spring of 2023. I have prior
          experience in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Visual Basic, Java,
          Python, and C++. I have plenty of leadership experience, including
          Treasurer of the FGCU running club, lead sales associate at Leslie's
          Bradenton, and lead software developer for a local start-up.
